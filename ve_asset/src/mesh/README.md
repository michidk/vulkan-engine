# Mesh Importers

## Meta file example

Default settings:
```toml
calculate_normals = false # should the normals be ignored and recalculated?
flip_axis = [true, false, false] # are we importing from a different coordinate system?
```

X flip is enabled by default because that what most `.obj`-files use (Blender).
